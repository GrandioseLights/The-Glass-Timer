The `Tinkercad-TGT` file can be uploaded to [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/). **The code for the Arduino component in the Tinkercad file will not be regularly updated unless the hardware is modified. You may upload the code from the `The-Glass-Timer.ino` file manually.**

This Repository was made for a school assingment.
